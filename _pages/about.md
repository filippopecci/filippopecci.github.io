I am a scientist at the RFF-CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) in Milan (Italy). My research focuses on developing optimization-based energy systems models with high resolution and computational performance, providing decision support to accelerate transition to net-zero and resilient energy systems. Prior to joining EIEE, I was an associate research scholar at the ZERO Lab at Princeton University, working on computationally efficient methods to optimize planning and operation decisions in macro-energy systems. I earned a PhD from Imperial College London, where I was was also a postdoctoral research associate. At Imperial, my work focused on mixed-integer optimization for the design-for-control of resilient water supply systems.
